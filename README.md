# Splice_Project

Welcome to the Splice_Project repository! This project contains the code developed for my Master's thesis. The primary aim of this project is to apply variant splice prediction tools to genetic variants.

**Please note that the code is currently in development and is not yet workable on another user's system. At present, the code relies on locally installed software, but we are in the process of containerizing it.**

This repository is primarily set up for my supervisors to inspect the overall structure of the pipeline.

## Description

Splice_Project focuses on the analysis of genetic variants with an emphasis on their splicing implications. The codebase includes various tools and scripts that can be used to predict the effects of genetic variants on splicing. The insights gained from these analyses could have significant implications in the understanding and treatment of genetic disorders.

## Directory Structure

Here is a basic outline of the project's directory structure for a quick overview:


- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
- `results/`: Contains output files and results.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation and other notes.

## Installation

Currently, the code is not yet set up for installation and execution on systems other than the development environment. This section will be updated when the code is ready for general use.

## Usage

The code is primarily intended for inspection by my supervisors at this stage. When it is ready for general use, detailed usage instructions will be provided here.

## Contributing

As this project is part of a Master's thesis, contributions are not being accepted at this time. However, once the project reaches a more mature phase, we might consider contributions.

## License

The project's license information will be added soon.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors and the university for their support throughout the development of this project.

If you are a supervisor or a reviewer, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarifications.
